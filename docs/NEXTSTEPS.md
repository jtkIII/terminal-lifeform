# Next Steps

## A curated list of **next-phase ideas** that builds directly on what exists 👇

### 🧬 Tier 1: “Life Evolves” — Add Simple Depth to the Existing Simulation

* **Memory & Lineage Tracking**
  Keep a record of population history and show trends like *average lifespan*, *mutation rate drift*, or *adaptive strategies* over time.

* **Environmental Feedback Loops**
  Let `pollution`, `resource_availability`, or `temperature` evolve based on population size or behavior. E.g.:

  * More population → more pollution
  * High pollution → reduced growth rate

* **Behavioral Adaptation**
  Allow parameters like `interaction_strength` or `competition_intensity` to slowly change in response to conditions (like organisms “learning” strategies).

* **Carrying Capacity as a Function**
  Instead of a static number, tie `carrying_capacity` to resource levels, tech, or time — so worlds evolve rather than plateau.

### 🧠 Tier 2: “Societies Emerge” — Add Complexity at the Group Level

Mving beyond population size into social or collective dynamics:

* **Cooperation vs. Competition Dynamics**
  Split entities into cooperative vs. selfish types. Model how cooperation changes survival, mutation, and event responses.

* **Cultural Drift / Innovation**
  As generations pass, introduce “memes” (behaviors, strategies) that spread or die out based on fitness. Think *genetic drift* but for ideas.

* **Resource Specialization**
  Instead of one resource pool, introduce types (e.g., food, energy, shelter) and require balance. Overabundance in one may not compensate for scarcity in another.

* **Social Density Effects**
  Build on `optimal_density`: at very high densities, maybe “cities” emerge with faster innovation — or collapse due to conflict.

### 🌍 Tier 3: “Worlds Collide” — Add Inter-World or Multi-Species Complexity

Ambitious ideas emergent stories and rich behavior:

* **Multiple Species / Populations**
  Simulate predators, prey, symbiotes, or competing civilizations in the same world, each with their own evolving parameters.

* **Migration & Colonization**
  Allow overflow populations to *seed new worlds*, carrying mutations or cultural traits with them. Great for “galactic life” simulations.

* **World-to-World Influence**
  Worlds could trade resources, spread plagues, or trigger disasters in each other — turning the sim into a *network* rather than isolated nodes.

* **Catastrophic Evolution Events**
  Occasionally introduce world-changing events (AI, industrial revolution, climate collapse) that rewrite the rules — a way to simulate historical epochs.
